React Project: User Information Viewer
This project is a User Information Viewer built using React and JSONPlaceholder API. The application fetches and displays a list of users along with key details such as their name, email, and address. Users can also view detailed information about a selected user, including their company details and additional contact info.

With a focus on simplicity and usability, the project showcases API integration, dynamic routing for user detail pages, and a responsive design for a seamless user experience. It highlights the practical use of React for handling API data and managing component-based UI.
